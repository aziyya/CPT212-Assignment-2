**Boyer-Moore Pattern Searching Algorithm**

This program implements the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm, which is one of the most efficient algorithms for finding a substring (pattern) within a larger string (text).

**Features**
Allows users to input a text and search for multiple patterns within it.
Supports case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches.
Utilizes Boyer-Moore's bad character rule and good suffix rule for efficient searching.
Provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

**How It Works**
The program will check if the pattern exists in the text.
If found, it displays the starting index of the pattern in the text.
If not found, it notifies the user.
